Problem Statement No: CBP09
Problem Title : Domestic Waste Management
Ideas:
Comprehensive Recycling Programs: Implementing a robust recycling program that includes the collection and recycling of materials such as paper, plastics, glass, and metals. Providing easily accessible recycling bins and educating residents on proper sorting techniques can significantly reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills.

Composting Initiatives: Encouraging composting of organic waste such as food scraps, yard trimmings, and paper products. Municipalities can provide compost bins or establish community composting sites where residents can drop off their organic waste, which can then be converted into nutrient-rich compost for use in gardening and landscaping.

Waste-to-Energy Facilities: Investing in waste-to-energy facilities that utilize technologies such as incineration or anaerobic digestion to convert non-recyclable waste into energy. These facilities can help reduce the volume of waste going to landfills while also generating renewable energy that can be used to power homes and businesses.

Community Clean-Up Campaigns: Organizing regular community clean-up events where residents come together to pick up litter and debris from public spaces such as parks, beaches, and streets. These events not only help beautify the community but also raise awareness about the importance of proper waste disposal and environmental stewardship.

Household Hazardous Waste Collection: Providing convenient drop-off locations for household hazardous waste such as batteries, electronics, chemicals, and paint. Proper disposal of these items is essential to prevent environmental contamination and ensure the safety of both humans and wildlife.
